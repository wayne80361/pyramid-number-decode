// given a number array and turn it into a pyramid
// example, [1,2,3,4,5,6] will turn into
// [[1],[2,3],[4,5,6]]

// not sorted but still increment by 1 from 1
// example, [2,4,1,7,6,5,3,9,8,10] will turn into
// [[1],[2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9,10]]

// each number will pair with a word
// figure only the word on the right from top to bottom
